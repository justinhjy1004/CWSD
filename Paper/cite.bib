abstract = {In this article we explore the issues that surround within-subject and between-subject designs. We describe experiments in economics and in psychology that make comparisons using either of these designs (or both) that sometimes yield the same results and sometimes do not. The overall goal is to establish a framework for understanding which critical questions need to be asked about such experimental studies, what authors of such studies can do to ameliorate fears of confoundedness, and which scenarios are particularly susceptible to divergent results from the two approaches. Overall, we find that both designs have their merits, and the choice of designs should be carefully considered in the context of the question being studied and in terms of the practical implementation of the research study.}

abstract = {The assumption is often made that one may perform an experiment by manipulating the independent variable within Ss or between Ss and that the effect of the independent variable would be the same in the 2 types of experiments. Many experiments in different areas of psychology show that this assumption is often false. In these experiments the design type is treated as an explicit independent variable in a factorially designed experiment. The outcome of these experiments is that there is an interaction between the design type and the substantive independent variable. These experiments are generally inefficiently designed or the results are poorly analyzed. The present paper develops a proper analysis of variance procedure for the analysis of the results of such an experiment and indicates a more efficient experimental design. A computational example is given. (16 ref)},

abstract = {In contrast with the expectations of many analysts, I find that raw policy-specific facts, such as the direction of change in the crime rate or the amount of the federal budget devoted to foreign aid, have a significant influence on the public’s political judgments. Using both traditional survey methods and survey-based randomized experiments, I show that ignorance of policy-specific information leads many Americans to hold political views different from those they would hold otherwise. I also show that the effect of policy-specific information is not adequately captured by the measures of general political knowledge used in previous research. Finally, I show that the effect of policy-specific ignorance is greatest for Americans with the highest levels of political knowledge. Rather than serve to dilute the influence of new information, general knowledge (and the cognitive capacities it reflects) appears to facilitate the incorporation of new policy-specific information into political judgments.},

The FDA annually receives the premarket applications of investigational medical devices, in which sponsors design and conduct crossover trials as their confirmatory clinical trials for evaluating safety and effectiveness of the devices. This article reviews the use of crossover clinical trial in pivotal clinical trials for high-risk medical devices regulated and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2005 to 2018. As an example, in which a crossover trial was implemented during the regulatory approval process of a new device, the article additionally presents the FDA-approved premarket approval (PMA) submission of the Medtronic MiniMed 530G system, an artificial pancreas device system that mimic a normally functioning pancreas by monitoring glucose levels and administering insulin at a certain threshold maintained by sensing blood glucose levels. The article also reiterates the critical regulatory considerations that the FDA made regarding the design and analysis of crossover trials in its guidance for industry.}

abstract = {Many students of statistics and econometrics express frustration with the way a problem known as “bad control” is treated in the traditional literature. The issue arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is intended to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of recent developments in the design and analysis of cross-over trials. We first consider the analysis of the trial that compares two treatments, A and B, over two periods and where the subjects are randomized to the treatment sequences AB and BA. We make the distinction between fixed and random effects models and show how these models can easily be fitted using modern software. Issues with fitting and testing for a difference in carry-over effects are described and the use of baseline measurements is discussed. Simple methods for testing for a treatment difference when the data are binary are also described. Various designs with two or more treatments but with three or four periods are then described and compared. These include the balanced and partially balanced designs for three or more treatments and designs for factorial treatment combinations. Also described are nearly balanced and nearly strongly balanced designs. Random subject-effects models for the designs with two or more treatments are described and methods for analysing non-normal data are also given. The chapter concludes with a description of the use of cross-over designs in the testing of bioequivalence.}
