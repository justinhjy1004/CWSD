# Counterbalanced Within-Subjects Design: Simulations and Replication Code

This repository accompanies the paper **“Causal Inference in Counterbalanced Within-Subjects Designs”** by Justin Ho and Jonathan Min (2025). It includes all simulation scripts, replication code, figures, and LaTeX source files necessary to reproduce the analyses and results presented in the manuscript.

## Overview

The repository serves two primary purposes:

1. To replicate the simulation studies illustrating identification challenges in counterbalanced within-subjects designs.
2. To provide a reproducible pipeline for generating the figures and results in the associated paper.

## Folder Structure

```
.
├── Control_Carryover.R              # Simulation of interactive vs. compounding carryover effects
├── CWSD_simulation.R                # Comparison of estimation strategies in CWSD vs. sequential randomization
├── Replication_PrepostDesign/      # Replication code for Clifford et al. (2021) Experiment 2
├── Figures/                         # All figures generated by the simulations and used in the paper
├── Paper/                           # LaTeX source files and Makefile for compiling the paper
├── Paper.pdf                        # Compiled version of the manuscript
```

## Dependencies

The simulations require the following R packages:

* `tidyverse`
* `stringr`
* `tools`
* `dagitty`

You can install them using:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "stringr", "tools", "dagitty"))
```

## How to Reproduce the Results

1. **Simulations**
   Run the following scripts in an R environment:

   * `Control_Carryover.R`
     Simulates carryover bias under different functional forms (interactive and compounding) and generates `CarryoverEffect.png`.

   * `CWSD_simulation.R`
     Compares estimation strategies across two designs and generates `Design_Comparison.png`.

2. **Paper Compilation**
   Navigate to the `Paper/` directory and run:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will compile the LaTeX source into `Paper.pdf`.

3. **Pre-post Replication (Optional)**
   See `Replication_PrepostDesign/` for code replicating Clifford et al. (2021), referenced in the paper.

4. **Directed Acyclic Graph Analysis** `DAG_Analysis.R`
* The DAG file used for analyzing causal graphs is not included here.
    This script analyzes all the Directed Acyclic Graphs introduced throughout the course of paper. We use `dagitty` in our analysis.

    
## Notes

* All output plots are saved to the `Figures/` directory and referenced directly in the paper.
